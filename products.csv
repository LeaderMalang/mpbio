MFCD00677817 ","
SKU ,
0215883701 ,
Application Notes ,
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Kit contains inhibitors with a broad specificity for serine, cysteine, and acid proteases, and aminopeptidases. It has been tested on a wide variety of cells and tissue extracts to isolate/maintain intact proteins without degradation. ,
Base Catalog Number ,
15883701 ,
Biochemical Physiological Actions ,
Proteases are enzymes which direct their action upon proteins, cleaving their targets into smaller fragments consisting of polypeptides, peptides and amino acids. There are a myriad of proteases active against practically all proteins. Some proteases are quite specific, while others cleave many different proteins. MP Protease Inhibitor Cocktail covers a broad spectrum of protese inhibitors. ,

Pack Size ,
1 kit ,
Preparation Method ,
Place the contents of all four vials in one volumetric flask or other suitable container. Add water or buffer of choice to 100 mL. More concentrated solutions can be prepared as desired; however, leupeptin and pepstatin A will create more of a suspension at concentrations other than the suggested amount. The prepared solution is stable for 60-90 days when stored at 5 °C. Do not freeze the prepared solution, and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. ,
Typical Working Concentration ,
Typical working concentration for 100 mL of inhibitor cocktail: AEBSF Hydrochloride:50-400 mg/mL; EDTA disodium dihydrate:0.2-25 mg/mL; Leupeptin Hemisulfate: 0.5-1 mg/mL; Pepstatin A: 0.5-1 mg/mL ,

Unlike polyacrylamide, the consistency of the gels is more solid (but also less elastic); 2.) To demonstrate cross reaction in IEP (Immuno electrophoresis) and Ouchterlony (double diffusion) plates in which antibody-antigen precipitin lines are studied; 3.) to make gel plates or overlays for cells in tissue culture; 4.) To form a gel matrix (either beaded and/or crosslinked) which can be used in chromatographic separations. ,
